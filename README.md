This is a game with at least two players and maximum four players.
What makes it unique is that it mixes a platformer with asymmetry and rhythm.

## Universe
The Metronome, once the guardian of time, has gone mad. Its beats unleash sonic storms that threaten to destroy Lyrica. As the hero, you must follow it and uncover the source of its madness. But beware, each misstep brings you closer to the funeral melody. Each level is a score you must master. Learn to dance with the rhythm of the Metronome to overcome its traps and restore harmony to the kingdom.

## Recommendations
For the best experience, we recommend playing with **Three Players minimum, four Players the experience would be optimal, there is no difficulty and each character has a specific power-up to itself.**.  
To start a game, the players who wish to play the runners must choose the runners in question ( Two players cannot have the same runner) and the player who wants to play the Metronome chosen last because it is after his selection that the game begins.
